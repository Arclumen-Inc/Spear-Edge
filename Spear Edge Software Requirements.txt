Spear Edge Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Spear Edge software component. Spear Edge is a standalone application designed for advanced RF signal capture, classification using machine learning (ML), and confirmation in tactical or surveillance environments. It can operate independently or collaborate with Spear Tripwire via websocket communication over Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) radios. The primary goals are to receive cues, capture IQ samples and spectrograms, classify signals with ML, record unknowns for training, integrate with the Android Team Awareness Kit (ATAK) for situational awareness, and provide user interfaces for configuration and control.
This document serves as a blueprint for development, testing, and validation, ensuring the software meets user needs for reliability, performance, and interoperability with specified hardware and protocols.
